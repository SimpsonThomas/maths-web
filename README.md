## Linear Algebra Web App

This is a web application for demonstrating Linear Algebra in a visual way as part of Durham University's [Public Engagement in Mathematics](https://www.dur.ac.uk/faculty.handbook/archive/module_description/?year=2020&module_code=MATH3461) module.

This tool will be used in sessions with Yearr 12 and 13 Maths students at a sixth to demonstrate some key teachings.

With the web app students will be able to visualise how matrices affect the grid and the effect on shapes and lines.

It is currently hosted on Netlify:
- Dev: [https://linear-alg-pem-dev.netlify.app](https://linear-alg-pem-dev.netlify.app)
- Master: [https://linear-algebra-pem.netlify.app](https://linear-algebra-pem.netlify.app)
